	"_doc": "This config contains the schema for adjusting the slides or creating your own slides. To do so, first you need to determine the slide type; if it's a static slide with only navigation input and no data, the it is a 'TextSlide'. If it's a slide for taking in data it's an 'InputSlide', finally 'DynoSlide's are primarily for the experiment."
