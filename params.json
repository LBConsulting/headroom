{"name":"HeadRoom","body":"## THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT RELEASE\r\nPlease don't use it for production. We are releasing this software to github\r\nso that it may be further developed upon.\r\n\r\n### Features:\r\n* JSON-based configuration\r\n* JSON-based database\r\n* [bottle.py](https://github.com/defnull/bottle) for minimal, one-file implementations\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\n* To incorporate [greenlets](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/async.html#greenlets-to-the-rescue) into the application: This gives us an opportunity to do real-time testing.\r\n* To incorporate a python server / view module system. This would allow for\r\n\tuser-extensible programming ranging from networked economics experiments to\r\n\tEvent-Related Potential (ERP) testing with an EEG device. \r\n* To foster a community of scientists and hackers to help shape future\r\n\tpsychological research.\r\n* Incorporation of a key-value database such as Redis or Postgresql.\r\n\r\n### TODOs\r\nThis software is pre-alpha, but should give the apt programmer an idea of the\r\nintended result. It is **untested** as of this point, but I'm working on that.\r\nIf the code doesn't show it: I'm really not a great programmer, but I can\r\nusually hack things together\r\n* Testing (I'm not a TDD type, but I really should be `:(`). \r\n* Probably a re-factor of \r\n\r\n### Installation & Deployment\r\nIf you really want to give this a go, you'll need git, python2.6 or higher, and\r\nvirtualenv on your system. Activate the virtualenv, `pip install -r\r\nrequirements.txt` and `python headroom/app.py` should set you on your way. \r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\nReleased under an MIT License. You can do pretty much anything you want with\r\nthis code, so long as others can do the same (see the `LICENSE.markdown` file\r\nfor more information).\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\nSpecial thanks to Marcel Hellkamp's (@defnull) [bottle.py](https://github.com/defnull/bottle)","tagline":"Browser-based psych experiments.
